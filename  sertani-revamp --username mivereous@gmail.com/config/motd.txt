<strong>Last Updated:</strong> <i>5/24/2013</i>
<br>-Fixed Grand Protector's Quarters door name and required access
<br>-Replaced the Security Camera computer in Forensics with a Security Records one
<br>-Phazon mechas are now able to be built with corresponding circuitboards 
<br>*Will look like a Durand when being built, basically built the same way, minus the Durand Armor
<br>*Phazon mecha parts are granted to special members of staff, such as heads, as well as a couple of others
<br>*Phazon mecha can only be completed by gathering the remaining part from certain Gateway missions (not all of them contain the remaining bits!)
<br>-Added a shielding system to the singularity field. 
<br>*This is trial run for the shielding system, feedback belongs on the forum
